**Task Manager Application Overview:The task manager application is designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks and responsibilities by providing a user-friendly interface for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks. It includes essential features such as secure user authentication, allowing individuals to sign up and log in to their accounts, as well as profile management to update personal information. With built-in validation such as input field validation and email validation, the application ensures a seamless user experience while enhancing productivity and organization in both personal and professional settings. **

**This apps **contain** the following features:**

* Signup
* Login
* Logout
* Update profile
* Add tasks
* View tasks
* Update tasks
* Delete tasks

**This **app**lication** is**almost **a** precompiled** app**. However, students will develop some features,**such as adding tasks, viewing tasks, updating tasks, and **deleting** tasks**. **Students** will interact with GitHub when they develop the features.**

# **Assignment: Full-Stack CRUD Application Development with DevOps Practices**

## **Objective**

You have been provided with a starter project that includes user authentication using  **Node.js, React.js, and MongoDB**. Your task is to extend this application by implementing **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations** for a real-world application of your choice, while following industry best practices such as:

* **Project Management with JIRA**
* **Requirement Diagram using SysML**
* **Version Control using GitHub**
* **CI/CD Integration for Automated Deployment**

## **Requirements**

### **1. Choose a Real-World Application**

Select a meaningful use case for your CRUD operations. We will provide the list, you have to select it.

### **2. Project Management with JIRA and SysML**

* Create a **JIRA project** and define:
  * **Epic**
  * **User Stories** (features required in your app)
  * **Child issues & Subtasks** (breaking down development work)
  * **Sprint Planning** (organizing work into milestones)
* Document your JIRA **board URL** in the project README.
* Draw a requirements diagram

### **3. Backend Development (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)**

* Create a user-friendly interface to interact with your API (Some portion developed, follow task manager app)).
* Implement **forms** for adding and updating records.
* Display data using  **tables, cards, or lists (Follow how we showed data in task manager app)**

### **4. Frontend Development (React.js)**

* Create a user-friendly interface to interact with your API (**Some portion developed, follow task manager app)**.
* Implement **forms** for adding, showing, deleting and updating records (CRUD).
* Display data using  **tables, cards, or lists (Follow how we showed data in task manager app)**

### **5. Authentication & Authorization**

* Ensure **only authenticated users** can access and perform CRUD operations. (Already developed in your project)
* Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for user authentication (Use the task manager one from .env file).

### **6. GitHub Version Control & Branching Strategy**

* Use **GitHub for version control** and maintain:
  * `main` branch (stable production-ready code)
  * Feature branches (`feature/xyz`) for each new functionality
* Follow proper **commit messages** and  **pull request (PR) reviews** .

### **7. CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

* Implement a **CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions** to:
  * Automatically **run tests** on every commit/pull request (Optional).
  * Deploy the **backend** to **AWS** .
  * Deploy the **frontend** to **AWS**.
* Document your  **CI/CD workflow in the README** .

## **Submission Requirements**

* **JIRA Project Board URL** (user stories ).
* **Requirment diagram** (Using project features)
* **GitHub Repository** (`backend/` and `frontend/`).
* **README.md** with:

  * Project setup instructions.
  * CI/CD pipeline details.
